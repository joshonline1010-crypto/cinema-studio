[ASSISTANT]: {
  "video_title": "Tiny Robot's Discovery",
  "duration": "30 seconds",
  "scenes": [
    {
      "scene_number": 1,
      "description": "A tiny robot (about 2 inches tall) glides across a dewy grassy path in a sunlit garden.",
      "camera_angle": "Wide shot (low angle to emphasize robot's size)",
      "duration": "5 seconds",
      "notes": "Focus on the robot's movement and the surrounding environment. Add subtle camera movement to follow the robot."
    },
    {
      "scene_number": 2,
      "description": "The robot pauses near a vibrant flower (e.g., a glowing purple orchid) with dew droplets on its petals.",
      "camera_angle": "Close-up (medium shot with shallow depth of field)",
      "duration": "5 seconds",
      "notes": "Highlight the flower's details and the robot's sensors glowing faintly. Use soft focus for the background."
    },
    {
      "scene_number": 3,
      "description": "The robot extends a tiny arm toward the flower, its claw-like appendage hovering just above the petals.",
      "camera_angle": "Extreme close-up (macro lens)",
      "duration": "5 seconds",
      "notes": "Slow-motion effect for dramatic tension. Show the robot's mechanical joints moving smoothly."
    },
    {
      "scene_number": 4,
      "description": "The flower shimmers as the robot touches it—petals glow briefly, and a faint light pulse radiates outward.",
      "camera_angle": "Overhead shot (looking down at the interaction)",
      "duration": "5 seconds",
      "notes": "Add glowing particle effects around the flower. Use a warm color palette to emphasize the magical reaction."
    },
    {
      "scene_number": 5,
      "description": "The robot's body lights up in a sequence of colors, indicating it's processing the flower's energy.",
      "camera_angle": "Low-angle close-up (highlighting the robot's glowing features)",
      "duration": "5 seconds",
      "notes": "Include subtle sound effects (e.g., a soft chime) as the robot "charges" after the interaction."
    },
    {
      "scene_number": 6,
      "description": "The robot stands beside the flower, now surrounded by faint light particles, as the camera pulls back to show the peaceful scene.",
      "camera_angle": "Wide shot (dolly out from the robot and flower)",
      "duration": "5 seconds",
      "notes": "End with a serene, almost ethereal atmosphere. Add a soft ambient soundtrack to wrap the video."
