**2-4 seconds:**  
*Close-up of a confident, smiling "hot girl" (diverse, stylish) biting into a golden, glaze-dripping donut. The IMAX camera captures the crunch, the drip, and her infectious grin. Text overlay: "The Donut That *Melted* My Heart."*  

**4-6 seconds:**  
*Slow-motion shot of the donut’s glaze swirling, paired with a voiceover:*  
**"Donut Heaven – Where Every Bite is a Moment."**  

**6-8 seconds:**  
*Montage of diverse customers enjoying donuts, followed by a quick zoom into the shop’s logo ("Donut Heaven") with a tagline:*  
**"New. Hot. Unforgettable."**  

**8-10 seconds:**  
*Final shot: The girl waves, holding a donut, as the screen fades to the logo and website. Sound effect: "Crunch!"*
