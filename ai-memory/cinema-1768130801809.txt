[ASSISTANT]: **Video Prompt (Seedance 1.5 Pro - Dialogue Mode)**  
```
[SHOT TYPE]: Medium close-up, eye level, soft bokeh.  
[CHARACTER DESCRIPTION]: Confident woman with natural expressions, slightly tilted head, subtle eye contact.  
[CAMERA MOVEMENT]: Slow push-in, focus on eyes. She speaks warmly: "Let me show you how this works."  
[STYLE]: Cinematic UGC style, clean indoor lighting, natural room tone.  
[ASPECT]: 16:9 | [RES]: 2K  
```  

**Next Steps for Dialogue Flow:**  
1. **Shot 1 (Establishing):** Wide shot, static, subject in frame (same lighting/color grade).  
2. **Shot 2 (Dialogue):** Use above prompt for seamless transition.  
3. **Shot 3 (Reaction):** Close-up on face, same lighting, subject nods slowly, then settles.  

Would you like to refine the dialogue tone (e.g., "whispers softly," "exclaims excitedly") or adjust the character’s posture/setting?
