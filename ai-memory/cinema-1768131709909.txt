- **Color Grade**: Desaturated corporate blue tones with a touch of gold for the Rolex.

**NEXT SHOT SUGGESTION (SEQUENCE PLANNING)**  
**SHOT 2 (MEDIUM)**: THIS EXACT CHARACTER, THIS EXACT LIGHTING, medium shot. He speaks authoritatively: "This isn’t just a deal—it’s a legacy." Camera tracks his hand gesturing toward the window, then settles.  
**MODEL**: Kling-2.6 (smooth tracking motion).  
**COLOR GRADE**: Same desaturated blue, with the cityscape now in focus.

**NOTE**: The dialogue mirrors the character’s confidence and urgency, while the cinematography reinforces authority and strategic thinking. The Rolex and cityscape tie into the brand’s luxury/innovation ethos.
