[ASSISTANT]: **Transition Motion Prompt:**  
"Camera slowly pulls back from the girl’s face, revealing the full scale of the flames engulfing the dark alley, then tilts up to capture the neon-lit city skyline reflected in puddles, then settles."  

**Next Shot Plan (Sequence):**  
1. **SHOT 1 (ESTABLISHING):** Wide shot, static, flames engulfing the alley, girl in center frame, 2.39:1 aspect ratio, high contrast lighting.  
2. **SHOT 2 (MEDIUM):** THIS EXACT CHARACTER, medium close-up, her face lit by the fire, diamond grills glinting, slow dolly in, then settles.  
3. **SHOT 3 (WIDE):** THIS EXACT LIGHTING, THIS EXACT COLOR GRADE, crane shot up to reveal the burning wreckage and distant neon signs, 16:9, 2K resolution.  

**Director Style Notes:**  
- **Nicolas Winding Refn (Drive/Only God Forgives):** Neon-soaked visuals, slow-motion intensity, gritty urban setting.  
- **Cinematography:** Anamorphic lens flares, shallow depth of field, desaturated tones with fiery highlights.  

**Transition Explanation:**  
The pull-back and crane tilt create a shift from intimate intensity to environmental scale, maintaining the "badass" vibe while grounding the scene in its chaotic setting.
