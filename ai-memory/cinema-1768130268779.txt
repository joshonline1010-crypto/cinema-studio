[ASSISTANT]: **Revised Plan with Female Protagonist (Kubrick Horror Style):**  

**SHOT 1 (ESTABLISHING):**  
- **Type:** Wide shot, static, symmetrical corridor with vanishing point centered.  
- **Lens:** 18mm anamorphic, shallow depth of field.  
- **Lighting:** Single cold practical light from ceiling (flickering), casting long geometric shadows.  
- **Subject:** Girl (mid-20s) standing center frame, back to camera, hands clasped tightly.  
- **Details:** Floor tiles etched with faint, repeating symbols (Kubrick-esque obsession with patterns).  
- **Color Grade:** Desaturated, deep blacks, green-tinted shadows.  
- **Style:** Kubrick’s sterile, isolated aesthetic—emphasizing her vulnerability.  

**SHOT 2 (CHARACTER INTRO):**  
- **Type:** Low-angle Steadicam glide from floor level (18 inches above ground).  
- **Lens:** 50mm f/2.8, precise focus on her face.  
- **Lighting:** Single practical lamp casting long shadows, highlighting her trembling hands.  
- **Subject:** Girl seated at a desk, scribbling in a notebook (subtle drawing of a faceless figure).  
- **Details:** Desk covered in identical objects (clocks, mirrors, rulers)—symbolizing her trapped mind.  
- **Color Grade:** Same desaturated tones, cold blue undertones.  
- **Style:** Kubrick’s focus on psychological tension, her isolation amplified by the environment.  

**SHOT 3 (ACTION):**  
- **Type:** Extreme close-up on her face, slow dolly in (from floor level).  
- **Lens:** 85mm f/2.8, shallow depth of field.  
- **Lighting:** Flickering bulb casting harsh shadows across her face.  
- **Subject:** Girl’s eyes wide, pupils dilated, breath visible in cold air.  
- **Details:** Her lips slightly parted, as if screaming silently (Kubrick’s “frozen scream” motif).  
- **Color Grade:** Green-tinted shadows, deep blacks, no warmth.  
- **Style:** Kubrick’s clinical horror—her terror is both visceral and psychological.  

**SHOT 4 (DIALOGUE):**  
- **Type:** Tracking shot following her down an endless hallway (24mm lens distortion).  
- **Lens:** 24mm f/2.8, wide-angle distortion emphasizing her isolation.  
- **Lighting:** Flickering bulb casting jagged shadows, creating a sense of disorientation.  
- **Subject:** Girl walking slowly, head down, hands gripping her sides.  
- **Details:** Identical doors on either side (one slightly ajar, hinting at her past).  
- **Color Grade:** Same desaturated palette, cold tones.  
- **Style:** Kubrick’s use of space to evoke dread, her journey through a labyrinth of her own mind.  

**SHOT 5 (CLIMAX):**  
- **Type:** Wide shot of her in a vast, empty warehouse (16mm film grain).  
- **Lens:** 16mm f/2.8, grainy texture emphasizing the cold, sterile environment.  
- **Lighting:** Overhead practical light casting harsh shadows, highlighting her small frame.  
- **Subject:** Girl standing center frame, Kubrick stare (head down, eyes up at camera).  
- **Details:** Rows of identical boxes (each labeled with her name in a different language).  
- **Color Grade:** Deep blacks, green-tinted shadows, no warmth.  
- **Style:** Kubrick’s final shot—her defiance in the face of horror, a silent scream of survival.  

**Consistency Phrases:**  
- "THIS EXACT CHARACTER" (girl’s appearance, posture, and expressions).  
- "THIS EXACT LIGHTING" (single practical sources, cold tones).  
- "THIS EXACT COLOR GRADE" (desaturated, green-tinted shadows).  
- "Same costume, same lighting direction" (no changes to her attire or light source).  

**Narrative Flow:**  
- **Establishing Shot:** Isolation in a sterile environment.  
- **Character Intro:** Psychological tension through her actions and surroundings.  
- **Action:** Visceral horror of her terror.  
- **Dialogue:** Journey through a labyrinth of her own mind.  
- **Climax:** Defiance in the face of horror, a silent scream of survival.  

**Kubrick Style Elements:**  
- Symmetrical framing, cold lighting, precise lenses (18mm, 24mm, 50mm, 85mm).  
- Focus on psychological horror over gore.  
- Use of patterns, repetition, and isolation to evoke dread.  
- Clinical, unflinching gaze at the protagonist’s suffering.
