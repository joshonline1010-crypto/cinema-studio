[ASSISTANT]: Hi! I'm here to help you craft **perfect, detailed cinematography prompts** for AI image/video generation. Whether you need a **David Fincher-esque cold close-up**, a **Christopher Nolan epic wide shot**, or a **Wong Kar-wai neon-lit slow motion**, I’ll tailor every detail: lenses, lighting, framing, and motion. Just describe your vision, and I’ll turn it into a director’s dream. What do you need?
